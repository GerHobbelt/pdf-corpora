# **PDF Corpora**

This index references a number of the more significant public corpora (data sets) that may contain both valid and invalid, real and synthetic PDF files, reflecting the realities of processing PDF files 'from the wild'. In addition, targeted test suites for specific PDF features or ISO subsets of PDF are also listed. It is not intended to be a list of every website where PDFs may be obtained.

This informative resource is freely provided to all interested PDF developers, end-users and researchers. It does not reflect endorsement of any organization, website or corpus. If you currate, maintain or identify other corpora that you believe will be useful to the PDF industry and is freely available please contact us. Some corpora may require registration in order to access.


**CAUTION: like any file downloaded from the internet, good computer security and hygenie practices should always be employed as some of these corpora contain files that are malicious! Use at your own risk!**


## GovDocs1
- https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/files

This is a very well-studied and large corpus created in 2010, comprising almost 1 million documents from the USA .gov TLD, of which more than 231,000 are PDF documents. The above URL provides lots of detailed information and references. 


## CommonCrawl.org
- http://commoncrawl.org/

The Common Crawl corpus contains petabytes of data collected since 2008 and is the core data behind the Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org/). It contains raw web page data, extracted metadata and text extractions and, of course, millions and millions of PDF files gathered from across the web. 

### SafeDocs re-fetch CommonCrawl (Dec 2019)
- https://corpora.tika.apache.org/base/docs/commoncrawl3_refetched/

Critical information about the limitations and issues with PDFs in CommonCrawl can be found in "*Building a Wide Reach Corpus for Secure Parser Development*" by Timothy Allison, Wayne Burke, Chris Mattmann, Anastasia Menshikova, Philip Southam, Ryan Stonebraker and Virisha Timmaraju (NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory) from http://spw20.langsec.org/papers.html. 
As a result of this work, a re-fetch of more than 22,000 truncated PDF files in the December 2019 CommonCrawl dataset is currated at the above URL. 


## SafeDocs "Issue Tracker" Corpus
- https://corpora.tika.apache.org/base/docs/bug_trackers/
- https://corpora.tika.apache.org/base/packaged/pdfs/ (individual ZIP files for data from each open-source PDF processor issue tracker)

A reasonably-sized corpus created by a targeted deep-crawl of various issue trackers (e.g. Bugzilla, JIRA, GitHub) to extract PDF attachments on public bug reports for various well-known open-source PDF-aware implementations. These PDFs are not directly discoverable via standard internet search engines. By it's very nature, this large corpus has a higher than normal quantity of unusual and malformed PDFs.


## FoxHex0ne Mutations
- https://foxhex0ne.com/

A set of mutated PDFs (and other document formats) created via mutation-based fuzzing. See also http://foxhex0ne.blogspot.com/2020/01/lets-continue-with-corpus-distillation.html.


## OpenPreserve Foundation Format Corpus
- https://github.com/openpreserve/format-corpus

The is a digitial preservation focused corpus which is openly-licensed, and covers a wide range of formats and creation tools. 

### The Archivist's PDF Cabinet of Horrors
- https://github.com/openpreserve/format-corpus/tree/master/pdfCabinetOfHorrors

A smaller sub-corpus of PDF test files, created for detecting PDF features that are generally undesireable in an archival setting.


## Cal Poly Graphic Communications PDF/VT Test File Suite 1.0.1
- https://www.pdfa.org/resource/cal-poly-pdfvt-test-suite/

This suite provides a collection of four sets of graphically-rich, robust and valid ISO 16612-2 PDF/VT-1 files targeting high-volume variable data printing. Each set comprises PDFs with 10, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, and 15000 records and can be useful for examining how PDF technology scales as PDF file size and page counts increase.


## VeraPDF Test Suite for PDF/A
- https://www.pdfa.org/resource/verapdf-test-suite/
- https://github.com/veraPDF/veraPDF-corpus

The veraPDF test corpus targets the ISO 19005 family of PDF/A specifications (Versions 1B, 1A, 2B, 2U, 2A, 3B, 3U, 3A) as well as a number of additional PDF test files for ISO 32000-1:2008 (PDF 1.7). This test suite complements the Isartor and Bavaria PDF/A-1b test suites and follows their test file pattern:
 - all test files are atomic;
 - they are self-documented via the document outlines; and
 - the naming pattern and the directory structure indicate relevant parts of ISO 19005 specifications

### Isartor Test Suite for PDF/A-1b
- https://www.pdfa.org/resource/isartor-test-suite/

### Bavaria Test Suite for PDF/A


## BFO PDF/A Test Suite
- https://github.com/bfosupport/pdfa-testsuite

A collection of about 40 PDF documents that should either pass or fail a conformance test against the specified ISO 19005 PDF/A profile. The description.txt file lists the reason they should pass or fail. This collection was inspired by the Isartor test suite and follows a similar layout with respect to test case names, including the section of the PDF/A specification to which each test refers. Unlike Isartor there are also  valid documents which test a particular area of the specification.


## Ghent Working Group (GWG) Output Test Suite
- https://www.gwg.org/workflow-tools-downloads/test-suites/ghent-output-suite/

The Ghent Output Suite (currently v5.0) has been created for testing PDF processing in the graphic arts industry and to determine whether workflows are behaving as expected according to the ISO 15930 family of PDF/X standards. The PDF files provide a series of test patches that can be used by end users of graphic arts equipment as well as developers of applications that handle PDF files. This test suite is highly technical and a good understanding of ISO 15930 is essential.


## PDF/UA Reference Suite
- https://www.pdfa.org/resource/pdfua-reference-suite/

To serve as a reference for software developers and practitioners interested in best-practices for creating tagged and accessible PDF files, the PDF Association's PDF/UA Competence Center has posted a set of 10 PDF documents conforming to ISO 14289-1 PDF/UA-1.

## Matterhorn Protocol 1.02
